# Code Refactor Starter Code (M1 Challenge)

## Description

The purpose of this challenge is to have me Refactor Starter Code to have the website "Horiseon" follow accessabilty standards. This challenge was interesting and fun since it involved a lot of problem solving. I learned more about HTML semantic elements and how how to fix a link. I made sure to add comments on what I changed to invision what it would be like working with other collaborators on a team. I was motivated to work on ths challenge because I wanted to apply what I learned and practice on a real life work scenraio.

## Usage

The finished webpage for Horiseon looks like your typical company website but you can see the accessibilty standards being followed by inspecting the page. There you will see HTML semantic elements as well as image descriptions. You can also click on the words in the header and it will direct you to the correct section.
